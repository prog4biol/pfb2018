## A Few Good Practices in Coding

#### Writing clear scripts

**A not very clear version:**

```
vi script.py
```
The above name is not very descriptive.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import sys
n = int(sys.argv[1])
if n == 0:
	print(n, 'equals 0')
elif n > 0:
	print(n, 'is positive')
else:
	print(n, 'is negative')
```
The code is correct, but the variable has a non-descriptive name. There are no blank lines between portions of the code, and there is no indication about what the script is attempting to do.

**A clearer version:**

```
vi PFB_PS_2.5.py
```
The above name tells you the project (Programming for Biology), the problem set (PS_2), and the question (5).

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

# Filename: PFB_PS_2.5.py
# Owner: Shasta Webb
# Description: This script tests and prints to standard output whether a number is 0, positive, or negative.

#====================
# Required Modules
#====================

import sys

#===========
# Variables
#===========

myNum = int(sys.argv[1]) #Remember to turn command line arguments into integers!

#========
# Script
#========

if myNum == 0: #This line tests if n is equal to 0
	print(myNum, 'equals 0.')
elif n > 0:
	print(myNum, 'is positive.')
else:
	print(myNum, 'is negative.')

print('\nEnd of script.\n')

```

The code is much clearer. The variable is more clearly named, and the code immediately tells you the file owner, the name, and a short description for what it does. The libraries, the variables, and the scripts are clearly organized. There are comments that tell you what parts of the script do.

#### Creating a README.md file

When are README's useful?

* For personal organization when you have many projects ongoing (GitHub will automatically prompt you to write one when you create a new repository.)

* For collaborators or people interested in your code who need an overview of what it does

* To archive the purpose of the project, special instructions for installing or using the code, the language it is written in etc.

* Listing authorship and acknowledgements

* Here is a template that GitHub suggests for README files:

##### A quick note about Markdown

###### What is .md?

Markdown (.md) is a lightwight markup language. Markdown files are text files (like the ones you have been creating) with a small amount of formatting.
